# Flashcards

## Development
### Dependencies
* Java 8
* Maven 3
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### Architecture
The application consists of two main subsystems:  
A Spring Boot server-side module and an AngularJS-based
frontend module packaged into a single executable WAR
with Maven.  
Frontend assets are automatically generated by Webpack.

### Database
For quick development purposes, the application uses an
embedded HSQLDB instance to persist data.
This instance will be automatically fired up when you start
the application.

### Development Guide
- Install frontend dependencies. Go to flashcard-ui/src/main/ui and execute the following:
```bash 
yarn
```
- Start the Spring Boot server
- Open a console and start the Webpack Dev Server with
```bash
yarn devstart
```
- Open your browser at `http://localhost:10000/flashcard/`

The Spring Boot DevTools dependency will make sure to reload your Java classes
automatically, while Webpack Dev Server will regenerate webpack bundles when
any of the frontend assets change.
